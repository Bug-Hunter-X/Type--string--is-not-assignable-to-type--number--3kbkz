# Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where a string value is assigned to a variable with a number type. The error message 'Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number' indicates that the program is trying to assign a string value to a variable expecting a number. This often occurs due to improper type handling, unexpected input, or implicit type conversions.  The solution involves careful type checking and explicit type conversions to ensure that variables are assigned values of the correct types.
